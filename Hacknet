Note : This was made after I played around with the box so I don't think it will be much helpful
Another note : I hate Privilege escalation so , so no root haha

## We need to manipulate the web server and get credentials 

In Short : We find a SSTI ( Server Side Templete Injection) 
  -  We change our username into something like {{ users.1.email }} and {{ users.1.password }} <- This is done in Sequence not both at once
  - Then we like a post and see who who liked the comment
  - If we use burp to look at the response it provides the credentials of who who liked the comment

# If there are 5 people who liked that post then see in which sequence ( number ) your target is at and update your username into that number 
    Example : If your target is the fifth user who has liked the post then,
                    - First you change your username into {{ users.5.email }} // this gives you their email in respone of burp or curl
                    - Second {{ users.5.password }} // this gives you their password

#  YOU CAN USE CURL AS WELL BUT BURP WORKS BETTER FOR ME 

# Next Step : Compromise a user that is friends with backdoor bandit
  // Our target is to Compromise backdoor bandit name user who has liked only one post but that post is private 
  // That user who posted the post [ deepdive I think ] that was liked by backdoor bandit has liked other public posts

[Steps..]
Update username → Like the post →  Visit /likes/23 (all while proxied).

So Compromise the user then compromise backdoor bandit and you get -> SSH
[Finally got ssh creds...]

That was it Happy Hunting HAHA
